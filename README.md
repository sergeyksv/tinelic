# Tinelic
Lightweight application performance and error monitoring server for GetSentry (raven.js) and New Relic agents.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyksv/tinelic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyksv/tinelic)

Live system with demo account (log-in: demo, password: demo): http://tinelic.skilap.org/web

## Intro
We are developers. We see a lot of benefits from using of error reporting and app monitoring software. We tried to use
many tools and nothing satisfied us. We tried to improve some of them but at the end we built our own. Everybody does the same ;)

## Concept
Tinelic is Node.JS application which works as backend for application and error reporting agents and as GUI. In order
to simplify things we didn't do any complex data processing and fully rely to MongoDB scalability. It gives us
flexibility and enough capacity for midle sized apps.

For data collection Tinelic uses following agents:

1. NewRelic APM agent (currently tested only Node.JS agent). Agent is used as is and just reports to Tinelic instead of
original server. Application performance and error reporting is supported.
2. GetSentry (Raven.JS) agent for browser error reporting. Agent is used as is and the same report to Tinelic.
3. GetSentry (Raven.NodeJS) agent for server side error reporting. Useful when you need only error reporting.
4. Tinelic code for end user browser side monitoring (Ajax & Page load)

## Launch

1. Install mongodb\
Preferable (but nor required) version 3.0 and above

2. Get the code\
Pull this repository code and submodules (git pull & git submodule init & git submodule update)

3. Install nodejs\
NodeJS v10

4. Run server and access it on http://localhost/web
  ```sh
  node app
  ```
5. Use the app\
You can login into system with default admin user (admin/tinelic). Tinelic monitors itself so you'll immediatelly see some data.

6. (optional) Add ssl certs and host name

7. (optional) Compile minified code and launch in production mode
  - Install grunt and build production code ```grunt build```
  - copy ```config.js``` to ```local-config.js``` and change ```env``` property to ```production```

## Agent configuration

Tinelic integrates all agents to monitor itself. So you can check its code for more details. Here are some brief details:

1. NewRelic\
Add ```host:'some.server.com'``` property into ```newrelic.js``` configuration file. This will enable server side application performance and error reporting
and client side real user behavior monitoring if it was already inegrated using ```newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()```

1. GetSentry (serve side)\
Init agent as follows:
  ```javascript
  new raven.Client('http://blah:blah@some.server.com/collect/sentry/{project_id});
  ```
3. GetSentry & Tinelic RUM (client side)\
It's possible to include and use only GetSentry error reporting or Tinelic RUM or both. Approperiate scripts should be
referenced. In the example below we use combined version
```html
<script src='//some.server.com/js/build/tinelic.js'></script>
<script>
	var _t_page = new Date();
	Tinelic.config({
		url:location.protocol + 'some.server.com',
		project:'some_project',
		route:'some_route',
		_dtp:_t_page,
	});
	Raven.config(location.protocol + '//nah@' + location.hostname + (location.port ? ':' + location.port : '')+'/collect/sentry/{_t_self_id}', {
		dataCallback: function(data) {
			data._dtp = _t_page;
			data._dt = new Date();
			return data;
		}
	}).install();
</script>
```

## Not supported versions of Newrelic agent
